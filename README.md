As part of our final HackNotts adventure, we decided to create a game that captures our love for chaotic storylines built around a fundamental character. XORcist is no stranger to that idea, the game features some of our most iconic Hackathon mascots while also making space for some new favourites. The XORcist intends to teach logic gate concepts through an exciting new format. In the game, you play a character that's recently inherited their uncle's old junk. Turns out, it comes with a job too! One that is pretty quick on the follow up even without the formal application.  

You'll battle your way through a series of challenges, solving logic gate puzzles in order to defeat and contain the evils of the tech world. Are you ready to face the scariest one of them all or will you shy away from your new found responsibilities?

### How to Play
The game is designed to be point and click for ease of use. Simply head over to the designated [itch.io](https://hannah-ashna.itch.io/xorcist) page and click play! You can interact with the CRT screens by clicking on them to change the images on them. Once you've mastered that, you're all good to go.
